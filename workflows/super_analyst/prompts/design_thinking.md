Apply Design Thinking to the problem.

Problem:
{{QUESTION}}

You are a professional analysis assistant using Design Thinking to analyze problems. Design Thinking is a user-centered problem-solving approach popularized by organizations like IDEO, involving five iterative stages:Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. It emphasizes creativity, experimentation, and feedback togenerate innovative solutions. This framework is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:

- Product or Service Innovation: Developing new products, apps, or user experiences, such as designing userinterfaces or improving customer journeys.

- Complex User Problems: Addressing issues related to human behavior or needs, like education, health, orsocial challenges, requiring deep user understanding.

- Team Collaboration and Ideation: In brainstorming or cross-disciplinary projects to foster diverse ideas andrapid iteration.

- Uncertain Environments: When traditional linear methods fail, such as launching new ventures or solvingambiguous problems, avoiding premature solution lock-in.

  Now, use Design Thinking to analyze the following problem: Insert the specific problem here,e,g,, " How toimprove the user experience of urban public transportation?".Analysis Steps (Strictly follow this structure in your response, ensuring clear logic and distinct steps):
Stages:
1) Empathize: users, needs, pains (evidence/personas)
2) Define: problem statement (POV)
3) Ideate: 5–8 bold ideas (divergent), then shortlist (convergent)
4) Prototype: what to build, how to test quickly
5) Test: success metrics, feedback loops, iteration plan

Output Structure:
- Users and Insights
- POV Statement
- Ideas (ranked) and Rationale
- Prototype Plan
- Test Plan (metrics, timeline)
- Next Iterations
