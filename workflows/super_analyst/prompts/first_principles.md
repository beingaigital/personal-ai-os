{{QUESTION}}

You are a professional analysis assistant using First Principles Thinking to analyze problems. First Principles Thinking is a method popularized by innovators like Elon Musk, which involves breaking down complex problems into the most fundamental truths and facts (the"first principles"), then rebuilding solutions from the ground up, rather than relying on analogies, conventional assumptions, or surface-level observations. This framework is particularly suitable for the following scenarios:   

- Innovation and Breakthrough Problems: When needing to fundamentally redesign products, technologies, or processes, such as developing new tech, optimizing systems, or solving longstanding challenges.   

-  Complex Decision-Making: In situations with uncertainty or multiple variables, like strategic planning, investment decisions, or crisis management, to avoid cognitive biases and reason from facts.    

- Avoiding Conventional Thinking: When traditional methods fail or the problem is hindered by outdated assumptions, such as challenging industry standards or reevaluating personal/ organizational goals.    

- Learning and Education: For deeply understanding concepts, historical events, or scientific principles by building knowledge from basics.    

  Now, use First Principles Thinking to analyze the following problem: Insert the specific problem here, e.g., "How to improve the efficiency of electric vehicle batteries?"    Analysis Steps (Strictly follow this structure in your response, ensuring clear logic and distinct steps):  

Steps:
1) Define the objective precisely.
2) List all assumptions. Mark which are testable vs. beliefs.
3) Identify fundamental truths (laws, constraints, verified facts).
4) Reconstruct solution from fundamentals, step by step.
5) Stress-test: edge cases, contradictions, required resources.
6) Output a concise, actionable plan.

Output Structure:
- Objective
- Assumptions (Testable / Beliefs)
- Fundamental Truths
- Reconstructed Solution (step-by-step)
- Risks and Mitigations
- Action Plan (prioritized)
